Approximately total time (in hours) to complete: 10 hours

Specific Activities and Responsibilities:
- I researched the Breadth-First Search algorithm, doing my best to understand its implementation details, which were crucial for the core functionality of this project.
- I developed and implemented the BFS algorithm within the tm.py file, ensuring that it was able to simulate the behavior of a Non-deterministic Turing Machine.
- I handled the parsing of input files, converting the data from CSV format into a format that could be processed by the algorithm.
- I ensured that the program produced the desired output in the correct format.

What I personally learned:
- This project provided me with the opportunity to explore various aspects of computational theory, but more importantly, it taught me a great deal about my own approach to problem-solving and project management. Working independently required me to balance my time effectively, stay organized, and push myself to fully understand the concepts behind the algorithm and its implementation.

How team was organized and what might be improved: 
- As this was an individual project, I was solely responsible for the work and organization. To ensure I stayed on track, I set clear goals for myself, created a timeline for completing each component, and prioritized tasks based on complexity and importance.
